# **DeleteStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociationById**
> void DeleteStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociationById (string id, string ifMatch = null)

Deletes an existing resource using the resource identifier.

The DELETE operation is used to delete an existing resource by identifier. If the resource doesn't exist, an error will result (the resource will not be found).

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v73.Apis.All;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v73.Client;

    public class DeleteStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociationByIdExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://api.ed-fi.org:443/v7.3/api/data/v3";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2_client_credentials
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new StudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociationsApi(config);
            var id = "id_example";  // string | A resource identifier that uniquely identifies the resource.
            var ifMatch = "ifMatch_example";  // string | The ETag header value used to prevent the DELETE from removing a resource modified by another consumer. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Deletes an existing resource using the resource identifier.
                apiInstance.DeleteStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociationById(id, ifMatch);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)

<a id="poststudenteducationorganizationresponsibilityassociation"></a>
# **PostStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation**
> void PostStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation (EdFiStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation edFiStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation)

Creates or updates resources based on the natural key values of the supplied resource.

The POST operation can be used to create or update resources. In database terms, this is often referred to as an \"upsert\" operation (insert + update). Clients should NOT include the resource \"id\" in the JSON body because it will result in an error. The web service will identify whether the resource already exists based on the natural key values provided, and update or create the resource appropriately. It is recommended to use POST for both create and update except while updating natural key of a resource in which case PUT operation must be used.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v73.Apis.All;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v73.Client;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v73.Models.All;

            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2_client_credentials
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var edFiStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation = new EdFiStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation(); // EdFiStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation | The JSON representation of the \"studentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation\" resource to be created or updated.

            try
            {
                // Creates or updates resources based on the natural key values of the supplied resource.
                apiInstance.PostStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation(edFiStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation);
            }

<a id="putstudenteducationorganizationresponsibilityassociation"></a>
# **PutStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation**
> void PutStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation (string id, EdFiStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation edFiStudentEducationOrganizationResponsibilityAssociation, string ifMatch = null)

Updates a resource based on the resource identifier.

The PUT operation is used to update a resource by identifier. If the resource identifier (\"id\") is provided in the JSON body, it will be ignored. Additionally, this API resource is not configured for cascading natural key updates. Natural key values for this resource cannot be changed using PUT operation, so the recommendation is to use POST as that supports upsert behavior.

            var ifMatch = "ifMatch_example";  // string | The ETag header value used to prevent the PUT from updating a resource modified by another consumer. (optional) 

            try
            {
