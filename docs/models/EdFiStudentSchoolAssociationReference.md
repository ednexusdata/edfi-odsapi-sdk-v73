**EntryDate** | **DateOnly** | The month, day, and year on which an individual enters and begins to receive instructional services in a school for each school year. The EntryDate value should be the date the student enrolled, or when the student&#39;s enrollment materially changed, such as with a grade promotion.  Note: Date interpretation may vary. Ed-Fi recommends inclusive dates, but states may define dates as inclusive or exclusive. For calculations, align with local guidelines. |
